      <h2>Hello, I am Bristo, a young coder creating games using code.org and visual studio</h2>
      <p>This website was created to display some of the games i have created such as Block Maze, Paddle Game, Trex Runner Game, Basketball Game, the World's Hardest Game, Snake and Pac-Man </p>
      <h2>I am 14, living in Brisbane, Australia  </h2>
      <h2>Some of my other hobbies include learning piano and playing video games</h2>
      <p>Let me tell you something about pianos.. the first piano was an acoustic, keyboard and stringed musical instrument where the strings were struck by wooden hammers, coated with a softer material.</p>
      <p>The piano was invented in Italy in 1709 by harpsichord maker Bartolomeo di Francesco Cristofori.
        The word piano is the shortened version of the word pianoforte, which means soft (piano) and loud (forte).</p>
      <p>Videogames, an entertaining way of burning time. The first ever video games included pong, tank, space race, tennis for two and many more. Videogames all started in the 1950's 60's where computer scientists began creating simple games and simulations on computers. </p>
